## 🧭 Overview

**To FLAC Converter** is a Mac-native utility that standardizes messy audio libraries into **clean, archival-grade FLAC** with **batch processing, high-quality resampling, true-peak-safe normalization, and rich metadata mapping**. Drop folders, external drives, or watch directories into the app and get **predictable, spec-correct FLAC** out—organized with tokenized filenames, mirrored folder structures, and embedded tags/artwork that survive round-trips to players, streaming tools, and asset managers. Unlike quick-and-dirty transcoders, To FLAC Converter treats ingest as a **conversion + conformance** pipeline: it analyzes sources, decides whether SRC/dither/gain/channel ops are needed, applies them transparently, and **verifies** each file against your chosen recipe before marking it done. The result: a lossless library that’s **portable, searchable, and future-proof**—perfect for collectors, podcasters, engineers, and teams publishing long-lived assets.

## ❓ What is To FLAC Converter? (Very detailed)

**To FLAC Converter** turns mixed codecs (MP3/AAC/ALAC/AIFF/WAV/CAF/OGG/Opus/WMA/AC3 and more) into **lossless FLAC** while preserving as much **metadata** as the source allows. It is built around four ideas:

1) **Scale without drama.** True batch queues and **watch folders** handle thousands of files, auto-retrying problematic inputs without blocking the rest. The UI stays responsive while multi-core workers push throughput on Apple Silicon.
2) **Audio math that respects the source.** If a track is already PCM at the target sample rate/bit depth, the app avoids needless resampling. When SRC is required, it uses a high-stopband, low-ripple engine; when reducing bit depth from float/32-int to 24/16 for FLAC, it applies **TP-aware triangular dither** (optional noise shaping) so quiet passages remain natural. Optional **integrated loudness** leveling hits a target LUFS with a **true-peak ceiling**, or you can leave gain untouched for archival fidelity.
3) **Metadata that actually survives.** Tags (artist/album/title/track/disc/genre/date/ISRC/lyrics/comments), artwork, and replay-gain information are mapped to FLAC/Vorbis fields consistently. Where sources carry BWF/iXML/ID3 specifics, the app translates what makes sense and logs what doesn’t—so you keep a paper trail.
4) **Output you can trust.** Every file is validated for container integrity, stream properties (sample rate/bit depth/channels), and tag schema. File names are created with **tokens** (`{Artist}`, `{Album}`, `{Track:02}`, `{Title}`, `{OrigSR}`, `{Year}`), and outputs can **mirror source folders** for traceability or collapse into a single target for deliveries.

Because workflows differ, To FLAC Converter uses **recipes**. A **Hi-Res Archive** recipe might set 96 kHz/24-bit stereo, disable loudness changes, and embed large cover art. A **Podcast Masters** recipe could normalize to −16 LUFS, cap at −1.0 dBTP, sum to mono when requested, and tag episode/season fields. A **DJ Prep** recipe might force 44.1 kHz/16-bit, write BPM/key from sidecars, and trim DC offset. Each recipe is **reusable and shareable**, so teams keep output consistent release after release.

Error handling is pragmatic. Corrupt frames, truncated headers, or unknown chunks are **quarantined** with readable logs while the queue continues. Replay-gain can be written for players that support it; artwork can be resized to your policy; and channel operations include **sum to mono** (with headroom), **channel split/join**, and **phase-safe downmix** for problem material. Nothing touches your originals—conversion is **non-destructive** by design.

## 🧪 Common Workflows

- **Collection Cleanup:** Consolidate MP3/AAC/odd rips into **44.1 kHz / 16-bit FLAC**, preserve tags/art, and normalize filenames for a neat, portable library.  
- **Hi-Res Archival:** Convert studio exports to **96 kHz / 24-bit FLAC** without loudness changes; embed big covers and retain session notes in comments.  
- **Podcast Pipeline:** Normalize guest recordings to **−16 LUFS**, cap at **−1.0 dBTP**, **sum to mono** when needed, write episode metadata, and mirror season folders.  
- **Broadcast Assets:** Enforce house specs, write ISRC/label/catalog fields, and export a delivery folder per campaign with tokenized names.  
- **Field/Legacy Audio:** De-containerize CAF/AMR/OGG into stable FLAC, trim DC offset, log any tag losses, and keep an auditable manifest.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Drag files/folders** into the app or set a **watch folder**.  
2. Choose a **Recipe** (e.g., 44.1 kHz / 16-bit, normalize off) or configure SR/bit depth/normalization/channel ops.  
3. Click **Convert**—watch progress, review per-file notes, and let errors auto-quarantine.  
4. Find finished FLACs in the **output directory** (mirrored or flattened), named by your **tokens** and fully tagged.

## 🖥 System Requirements

- macOS 10.13 High Sierra or later  
- Apple Silicon or Intel 64-bit  
- Enough disk for outputs and temporary buffers  
- Fully offline—no cloud processing
